<!-- # Reflections on CES 2025: Innovation, Gaps, and Shared Responsibility -->

It&apos;s been a few weeks since my participation in CES 2025, an event so vast that I initially felt like a small drop in the midst of a huge ocean of innovation. I&apos;m deeply grateful to Arionkoder, whose support made possible this transformative experience of attending CES 2025 with Bruno Fleischer.

I&apos;d like to share some reflections combining what I observed with what I felt:

---

## 1. The Potential of Technology… and Its Immediate Limits

CES always dazzles with prototypes and launches that seem straight out of science fiction. However, the question remains whether these innovations are truly accessible to most people or if, at least in the early stages, they remain aimed at an elite of consumers in highly developed markets. It&apos;s no secret that in their initial phase, many technologies tend to focus on those with greater resources.

**Why is this relevant?**

- **Market opportunity:** Under-served regions represent a huge business potential for companies that know how to adapt prices, distribution channels, and cultural content.
- **Shared responsibility:** Beyond profitability, there is a need for scalable solutions that contribute to development in diverse contexts.

## 2. Massive Automation or Labor Reconversion?

One of the most memorable moments was NVIDIA&apos;s keynote, showcasing surprising examples of Artificial Intelligence, such as AI Agents and Physical AI (digital twins) for robotics or autonomous driving tests. These tools promise to optimize processes and reduce risks, but inevitably raise a question:

> How will we tackle the reconversion of roles and skills?

> Are we prepared to train — and, if necessary, reposition — those whose tasks might be replaced by increasingly advanced systems?

On one hand, new specialized roles are emerging that never existed before; on the other, without leadership and training, millions of workers could be left behind. I believe the critical factor here is **speed**: while technology adoption moves rapidly, developing talent requires time and resources.

## 3. Emerging Markets: Caught Between Lack of Invitation and Self-Limitation

As a Uruguayan working for U.S.-based companies, I noticed a representation gap at CES. Many solutions seemed designed for markets with high consumer capacity, leaving open questions about how — or when — Latin America, Africa, and other emerging regions will be integrated into the global conversation.

However, the responsibility does not lie solely with the "big players." Emerging regions, and Latin America in particular, may also be letting opportunities slip by when it comes to projecting their talent and proposals on an international scale. Several factors contribute to this lack of visibility:

- **Focus on local markets:** Sometimes, the urgency of solving regional problems or the absence of an internationalization and non global vision plan limits their presence in global forums.
- **Untapped potential:** Latin America and Africa are not only huge growing markets; they also boast innovative talent and unique perspectives for solving local challenges with cutting-edge technology.

In an increasingly interconnected world, both the global industry and emerging regions themselves face the challenge (and opportunity) of building bridges, forming partnerships, and driving more active participation.

## 4. Inspiring Cases: Technology as a Tool for Well-Being

Despite the clear orientation toward large ecosystems and big budgets, I found some proposals that reminded me of technology&apos;s more human and inclusive side. For instance:

- **Flint:** Paper batteries, winners of the Best of CES Sustainability award, offering a more eco-friendly and accessible alternative to lithium-ion.
- **MindMics:** Earbuds capable of monitoring cardiac health with greater precision than a conventional smartwatch.
- **Readyland, LLC:** Children&apos;s books linked to voice assistants (Alexa) to encourage reading habits among the youngest audiences.
- **PreEvnt:** A device (Isaac) that measures blood glucose through breathing, eliminating the need for needles.
- **MoveR:** A French augmented reality platform for treating cognitive disorders such as dyslexia.

These projects may not top the "most talked-about" lists, but they aim to address real-world needs, reminding us that technology is not just about spectacle or premium markets; it can also serve as a tangible driver of progress.

## 5. Balancing Skepticism and Optimism

CES 2025 left me with mixed feelings. On one hand, the rapid pace of technological development and AI solutions thrills me: I see a future where many repetitive or dangerous tasks are automated, and where entirely new services emerge. On the other, I&apos;m concerned about how prepared — or unprepared — we are to include emerging markets and workers who might be affected.

**My main takeaways are:**

- **Market diversification:** Companies looking to scale globally will have to explore business models that include traditionally underserved countries and segments. Meanwhile, emerging economies themselves should push for greater representation on international stages.
- **Training and labor adaptation:** Reconversion is not just a social challenge; it&apos;s also a business necessity to ensure access to skilled talent.
- **Innovation with real impact:** Beyond novelty, solutions that solve specific problems can open doors to massive markets and improve many people&apos;s quality of life.

## 6. An Open Question

The big question on my mind is: **How can we align commercial interests with the need to include more people and regions in this accelerated transformation?** Every company, government, and educational institution will have to find its role in this ecosystem.

What I am convinced of is that technology is only as valuable as the responsible use we give it. That&apos;s why I believe it&apos;s crucial to keep the dialogue going, share findings, and, above all, promote solutions that allow more players to join in rather than fragment the landscape further.

*What strategies do you consider key for bringing technological innovation to more sectors and regions, especially from emerging countries?*

I&apos;d love to continue this conversation and hear other viewpoints. In the end, the advances we saw at CES are just a glimpse of what&apos;s coming, and together we can help create an environment where technology isn&apos;t a luxury but a driver of shared growth and well-being.
